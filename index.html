        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>I was born on October 15, 2001 in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

        <h2>Current Life</h2>
        <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>My father was a self-taught guitar player and was always playing music around the house. I initially got started in music playing the guitar when I was around 7 or 8 just like my dad, although I wasn't very good and I lost interest. However, in 5th grade I joined the school band and began to play the trumpet, which I had a natural aptitude for. I was the first chair trumpet player at my middle school and high school as well as having played with the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra. In addition to the trumpet, I am also a self-taught piano and bass player.</p>


        <h3>Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
        <p>Like many other computer programmers, I have fallen down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole and am on the never ending quest to find the perfect one. I generally prefer linears, but I also love a good tactile. My current daily driver is the NK65 Entry Edition with AKKO Neon keycaps and Glorious Panda switches.</p>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Since I was a kid, I've always been an avid gamer. Some of my favorite franchises are Mario, Zelda, Metal Gear, and Resident Evil. I primarily play on PC nowadays. I'm currently repping a Ryzen 5 3600 with a GTX1060 that I built myself, but hope to upgrade the GPU once the prices drop. I am also currently addicted to chess. My all time peak rating is 1271 on chess.com, although I am getting close to cracking it once again!</p>
