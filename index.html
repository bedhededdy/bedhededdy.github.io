                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>I was born on October 15, 2001 in Chicago, Illinois. I grew up in one of the suburbs of Chicago called Itasca. I lived in a beautiful town house with my mother, father, sister, and pet dog. As a young kid I loved to read, watch movies, play music, and most of all play video games. Later in my youth I attended Lake Park High School and was involved in activities like band and math team. I won awards for outstanding performance in both of these activities, however the awards I'm most proud of are "Most Outstanding Freshman in Marching Band" and "Most Outstanding Junior in Wind Symphony" </p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>My father was a self-taught guitar player and was always playing music around the house. I initially got started in music playing the guitar when I was around 7 or 8 just like my dad, although I wasn't very good and I lost interest. However, in 5th grade I joined the school band and began to play the trumpet, which I had a natural aptitude for. I was the first chair trumpet player at my middle school and high school as well as having played with the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra. In addition to the trumpet, I am also a self-taught piano and bass player.</p>

                    <h3>Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
                    <p>Like many other computer programmers, I have fallen down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole and am on the never ending quest to find the perfect one. I generally prefer linears switches, but I also love a smooth tactile with a pronounced bump. My current daily driver is the NK65 Entry Edition with AKKO Neon keycaps and Glorious Panda switches.</p>

                    <h3>Gaming</h3>
                    <p>Since I was a kid, I've been an avid gamer. Some of my favorite franchises are Mario, Zelda, Metal Gear, and Resident Evil. I primarily play on PC nowadays; my current rig is a Ryzen 5 3600 with a GTX1060 that I built myself, but hope to upgrade the GPU once the prices drop. I love board games as well, and am <em>extremely addicted</em> to chess. My all time peak rating is 1339 on chess.com, although I am getting close to beating it once again!</p>
