My website consists of two pages: an about page and a resume page. The about page contains
information about my life from childhood until the present and shows off some of my hobbies.
The resume page contains the info from my resume pdf submitted earlier, but marked up using
HTML and CSS. It also includes an option to download my resume in the pdf format. 

I wish I could have made the final product look prettier, mostly the resume page.
I like the white on black, but it just seems a little empty and plain to me. 
I also wish I could have found a way to make the layout of the resume page a little more
consistent with the look of the about page without making either of them look weird. For instance
in the current configuration, I have the nav centered on the about page but the resume page
is left-aligned, so having a centered nav would look bizarre. I experimented with a centered
resume, but I didn't like how it looked. I would also rewrite the CSS in a much cleaner way;
as it is now, it is very hacked together and could be more concise and more easily modifiable.
Lastly, I couldn't get the weird bit of white at the bottom of the resume page to go away. The
white at the top was intentional, but the bit at the bottom was some CSS issue I couldn't 
resolve in time.
